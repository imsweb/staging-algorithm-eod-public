  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods. ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction).\n* Lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are counted as positive lymph nodes\n\n**Note 3:** In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph node(s) or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis with positive lymph node(s) are coded under regional lymph nodes.\n* Code 600 if there are **clinically** in-transit metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 650 if there are **clinically** in-transit metastasis WITH regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 700 if there are **pathologically** in-transit metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 750 if there are **pathologically** in-transit metastasis WITH regional lymph node involvement\n\n**Note 4:** Bilateral or contralateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy. Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.\n* Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n**Note 5:** Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins and are coded as regional nodes.\n\n**Note 6:** Regional lymph nodes for skin\n* Single, Multiple, Ipsilateral\n  - See *EOD Mets* for contralateral or bilateral nodes (except for head and neck skin primaries)\n\n**Head and Neck skin primaries only (C000-C002, C006, C440, C442-C444) (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n- Levels I-VII \n- Axillary (neck only, C444)\n- Cervical, NOS\n- Deep cervical, NOS\n- Facial (buccinator, buccal, nasolabial)\n- Internal jugular, NOS\n- Parapharyngeal \n- Parotid (infraauricular, intraparotid, periparotid, preauricular)\n- Retroauricular (mastoid)\n- Retropharyngeal\n- Suboccipital\n\n**Skin of trunk (C445)**\n- Upper trunk\n  + Axillary\n  + Cervical\n  + Internal mammary\n  + Supraclavicular\n- Lower trunk\n  + Superficial inguinal (femoral) \n\n**Skin of upper limb and shoulder (C446)**\n- Axillary\n- Cervical\n- Epitrochlear for hand/forearm\n- Internal mammary (parasternal)\n- Spinal accessory for shoulder\n- Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)\n\n**Skin of lower limb and hip (C447)**\n- Femoral (superficial inguinal)\n- Inguinal\n- Popliteal for heel and calf\n\n**Vulva (C510-C512, C518-C519)**\n- Deep inguinal, NOS\n- Femoral\n- Inguinal, NOS\n- Inguinofemoral (groin)\n- Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n- Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Penis (C600-C602, C608-C609)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric, obturator)\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial [femoral] \n- Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Scrotum (C632)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric), NOS\n        * Obturator\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Deep inguinal, NOS\n        * Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial inguinal (femoral)",
